This bug occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native with a large dataset.  The performance can degrade significantly, causing slow scrolling or even crashes.  This is often due to inefficient rendering or key management within the FlatList.  Specifically, if the `keyExtractor` prop is not correctly implemented or is missing, it can lead to performance issues and incorrect rendering of list items. In addition, using complex components within the list items without optimization can add significant overhead.
